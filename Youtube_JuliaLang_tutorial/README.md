These tutorials accompany the video introduction into **DynamicalSystems.jl** that is posted on the JuliaLang youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13hqE_1a158&t=5536s

Even though the video was done on Julia version 0.6, the Jupyter notebooks have been updated! They run on Julia version 1.0.0 or higher, and require `DynamicalSystems` version 1.0.0 or higher!
